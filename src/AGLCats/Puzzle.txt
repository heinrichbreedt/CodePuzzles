A json web service has been set up at the url: http://agl-developer-test.azurewebsites.net/people.json

You need to write some code to consume the json and output a list of all the cats in alphabetical order under a heading of the gender of their owner.

You can write it in any language you like. You can use any libraries/frameworks/SDKs you choose.

Submissions which include tests will be looked upon more favourably

Example:

Male

Angel
Molly
Tigger
Female

Gizmo
Jasper

Use of libraries for consumption of web services is encouraged. Eg: C# -> HttpClient, Java -> HttpClient, Javascript -> jQuery
You can write it in your favourite Text Editor/IDE
